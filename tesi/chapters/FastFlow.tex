\section{FastFlow}
FastFlow is the result of a joint effort of the Parallel Programming Model Group of the University of Pisa and the Parallel Computing Research Group of the University of Turin. FastFlow is a C++ structured parallel programming framework originally targeting cache-coherent shared-memory architectures \cite{fastflow}, which was recently extended with a distributed-memory RTS in order to allow developers to develop and deploy FastFlow applications over remote nodes.  and successively extended for the distributed-memory setting via the implementation of a renewed RTS allowing for a FastFlow application to be split into multiple groups that can be deployed on different nodes across the network via an internal loader module.
